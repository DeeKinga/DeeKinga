- 👋 Hi, I’m FarkasDeeKinga and this is my GitHub portfolio.
- 👀 I’m interested in Quality Assurance Software Testing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Software Testing opportunities.

I'm always willing to learn, searching for new things so that I can develop myself. I consider myself optimistic and curious.
Prepared using all the knowledge that I had acquired during the manual testing course from Itschool, where I had learned about Agile, writing test cases and bug reports, API testing with Postman, automation testing with Selenium, performance testing and basic concepts of MySQL.
This Course is completed with an online QA course from Udemy.
